\section{housing data}
dim(housing) = 506 14 \\
dim(housing\_train) = 404 14 \\
Hence, there are an equal number of X variables. However, the housing\_train\_prepped data has 61 more X variables.

\section{LASSO model}
$\lambda = 0.00139$ \\
In-sample RMSE = 0.1703 \\
Out-of-sample RMSE = 23.3683 \\

\section{Ridge regression model}
$\lambda = 0.0373$ \\
In-sample RMSE = 0.1734 \\
Out-of-sample RMSE = 23.3700\\

\section{question 10}
You cannot estimate a simple linear regression model if a data set has more columns than rows because you would be faced with over-fitting. This means the bias will be very low, but the variance will be very high. \\
Based on the RMSE values of the models, I think the models are over-fitted. This is because the in-sample RMSE can be considered low, but the out-of-sample RMSE is quite high. In fact, the out-of-sample RMSE represent a range that covers almost half of the actual range of the original data set.\\
In terms of bias-variance trade-off, these models have very low bias, but very high variance. \\
